# SavePass
This project was developed along the promoted React Native specialization created by Rocketseat as a condition for approval and certification. The objective was to create an application capable of storing a user's passwords in a single place.
The user can register and identify which platform a password belongs to and the email registered there for login. It is also possible to perform case-insentitive searches in order to help the user experience.
